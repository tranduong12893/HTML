<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
<p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of <br/>
    ornamental and edible plants.</p>
<p>The Cottage Garden originated in <i><u>England</u></i> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-<br/>
    invented in 1980's England, when stylized verdions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorousl<br/>
    maintained <i><u>English estate gardens</u></i></p>
<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more pratical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and<br/>
    herbs, along tith some fruit trees.</p>
