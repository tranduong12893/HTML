    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
    <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <i>England</i> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1980's England, when stylized verdions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <i><u>English estate gardens</u></i></p>
    <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more pratical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along tith some fruit trees.</p>
